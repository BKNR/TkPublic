It should be stressed that I have mostly no idea what I'm doing.

Combot is a Discord bot that parses JSON files of character movelists and displays them in Discord chat using embeds.

Although core functionality is complete, this bot is still largely being rewritten, and will undergo changes as I get a better 
idea of what I'm doing.

The bot is written in Python, and uses the Discord.py wrapper, BS4, FuzzyWuzzy, and DateUtils.

To run the bot, create a txt file in the same directory as tekkenbot.py, paste your token in it and name it token.txt. Then execute discord.py.
