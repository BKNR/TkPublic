It should be stressed that I have mostly no idea what I'm doing.

Combot is a Discord bot that parses JSON files of character movelists and displays them in Discord chat using embeds.

Although core functionality is complete, this bot is still largely being rewritten, and will undergo changes as I get a better 
idea of what I'm doing.

The bot is written in Python, and uses the Discord.py wrapper, BS4, FuzzyWuzzy, and DateUtils.
