It should be stressed that I have mostly no idea what I'm doing.

Combot is a Discord bot that scrapes frame data from locally stored webpages (source from RBNorway) and displays them in chat.

Although core functionality is complete, this bot is still largely in development, and will undergo changes as I get a better 
idea of what I'm doing.

The bot is written in Python, and uses the Discord.py wrapper, BS4 and FuzzyWuzzy.

All frame data is sourced from RBNorway.
