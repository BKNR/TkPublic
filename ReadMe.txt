It should be stressed that I have mostly no idea what I'm doing.

Combot is a Discord bot that scrapes frame data from locally stored webpages (source from RBNorway) and displays them in chat.

The bot is written in Python, and uses the Discord.py wrapper, BS4 and FuzzyWuzzy.

All frame data is sourced from RBNorway.
